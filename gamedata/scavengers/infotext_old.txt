WATCH OUT: SCAVENGERS ARE ACTIVE IN THIS REGION

PHASE 1
1. Scavengers remain ABSENT FOR THE FIRST 5 MINUTES of a game, then appear from dark corners of the map.
2. ORBITAL DROPS will spawn Scavengers on BEACONS.
3. The Scavenger COMMANDERS are TOUGH and STEALTHY, and they can CLOAK.
4. Scavenger REZ-BOTS will SCAVENGE THE BATTLEFIELD for resurrectable wreckages.

PHASE 2
1. Scavenger Commanders will start to BUILD UP BASES and strong defenses to secure their perimeter.
2. Scavengers bases and units will 'LEVEL-UP' DYNAMICALLY with what happens on the battlefield.
3. Scavengers are MORE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS POWERFUL TEAMS that have a larger resource income.

PHASE 3
1. Scavengers will eventually start to drop BOSS-UNITS
2. It's up you to GAIN AND KEEP MAPCONTROL of the battlefield in order to keep Scavengers away.
3. It's wise to get as much RADAR COVERAGE as possible to prevent Scav Commanders from dropping down into the battle.
4. Finally: Don't forget to hunt down and DESTROY DROPPOD-BEACONS to prevent the Scavengers from dropping more units!

THE SCAVENGER COMMANDER IS TOUGH
He has 50% more health, is almost always cloaked and has stealth.
His Disintegrator Gun (D-Gun) could not be engineered as good as the original, and does a lot less damage and only fires once every 10 seconds. 
Despite this flaw, he does auto-regenerate health a lot faster, so it's wise to hunt them down and kill them.

THE SPECIAL ABILITIES
+ 20% more speed and more agile in combat
+ 25% more sight- and jamming-range
+ Higher idle/auto heal
+ 75% Faster build, reclaim and resurrect
½ Halve the cost in metal/nrg to produce
? Rumors tell that around 30% of their armada is cloaked
- 50% less Health
 
WHY DID THEY APPEAR?
That's unclear, but what we do know is that they can be a CURSE OR A BLESSING.

• A BLESSING, when you're under fire and they decide to COME TO YOUR AID and attack your stronger opponent.
• A CURSE, when you think you are owning your enemies, and they decide to COME AFTER YOU.

WHAT'S ALL THE FUZZ AND FUN ABOUT?
• Scavengers make battles MORE DYNAMIC AND MORE INTERESTING.
• They also add more randomness to each battle, including their BALANCING SKILLS in (uneven) matches.
• They build BEAUTIFUL BASES from all kinds of blueprints they have gathered in the past.
• When you think you're done and battle is almost over, then SCAVENGER BOSSES SUDDENLY APPEAR!
• Scavengers, even while being stealthy bastards, will fill up games with MORE DYNAMIC GAMEPLAY and MORE AREAS OF INTEREST.
• Scavengers stimulate map control, radar coverage, and encourage NEW KINDS OF STRATEGIES.

TIPS & TRICKS
• Try to clear out an area near your enemies base - chances are Scavengers will spawn there and THEY WILL/CAN ASSIST YOU IN YOUR FIGHT!
• It's possible to LURE A GROUP OF SCAVENGERS to your enemy. Scavengers are efficient hunters and almost always attack the closest units.
• Scavengers have to produce energy to cloak, so it IS possible to RUN THEM DRY ON ENERGY. Targeting large powerplant facilities (mid/late-game) can disrupt their cloak and stealth abilities, or even their firing power!
