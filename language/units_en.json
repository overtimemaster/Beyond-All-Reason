				"armart": "Shellshocker is an artillery vehicle used to take down T1 defenses, especially Heavy Laser Towers. It can outrange all T1 defense towers except coastal defense plasma batteries. Shooting its plasma shells along a parabolic trajectory they are obviously helpless in close quarters combat. Always keep them protected by Stouts/Blitzes, or your own defensive structures. Don't forget to have targets in your radar's range or scouted.",
				"armatlas": "The Stork is an airborne transportation unit. It can pick up all T1 land based units and T2, with exception of heavy ones, like Fatboy or Goliath. Use it for unexpected unit drops bypassing your enemy's defense line, but don't forget to scout first for any anti-air units. Drop your commander into their bases to Dgun all structures and humiliate your opponents. Can be used for transporting nano towers too, which enables you to move your buildpower where you currently need it.",
				"armbeaver": "Beaver is an amphibious construction vehicle, which can travel on land and underwater equally well allowing easy expansion between islands, under rivers and across seas. Its build menu includes some water based units like underwater metal extractors, tidal generators and most importantly the amphibious complex, a lab that includes T2 amphibious tanks and Bots. As all amphibious units it can easily cross stepper hills unlike regular vehicles. It can be destroyed by torpedoes so avoid submarines, launchers and destroyers. It is wise to use pairs of cons for expansion, so they can heal each other and build defensive structures faster. This makes them immune to light assault units like fleas/jeffys.",
				"armca": "A Construction Aircraft is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander. Moreover it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Aircraft Plant. Due to their speed, the highest amongst constructors, it may be used for quick expansions and reclaiming in areas far from your base. It can also access the whole map, as it doesn't care about any natural obstacles. It has a very low HP, so keep away from enemy's anti air units. Due to little build power you may want to use multiple air cons at once. Each Construction Aircraft increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 25.",
				"armck": "A construction Bot is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander. Moreover, it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solars and most importantly the T2 Bot lab. It is slightly slower and weaker than vehicle constructor, but it can climb steeper hills, so it is effective in expansion on mountainous terrain. Each Construction Bot increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 50. It is wise to use pairs of cons for expansion, so they can heal each other and build defensive structures faster. This makes them immune to light assault units like Fleas/Jeffies.",
				"armcv": "A construction vehicle is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander. Moreover it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Vehicle Lab. It is slightly faster and stronger than Bot constructor, but it can not climb very steep hills, so it is effective only in expansion on relatively flat terrain. Each Construction vehicle increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 50. It is wise to use pairs of cons for expansion, so they can heal each other and build defensive structures faster. This makes them immune to light assault units like fleas/jeffys.",
				"armfav": "Rovers are supercheap and fast to build vehicles used for scouting and damaging the early eco structures. It is the fastest arm vehicle but due to light armor any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foe's expansion! In T2 warfare Jeffies come as an effective counter to slow shooting units, like snipers, penetrators and artillery. When produced constantly and sent to the front they can pull the heavy fire on themselves while your T2 units deal damage to artillery.",
				"armfig": "The Freedom Fighter is a fast moving fighter jet that is designed for eliminating air units. It is the most effective form of T1 air defense that can access all parts of the map to get rid of any air threats. In large packs, it is also able to destroy weak land-based structures, like nano towers. Always put your fighters on patrol in front of your base, so they attack any aircraft moving in the vicinity. Send fighters with your bombing runs to disable opponent's fighter wall before your bombers come to deliver the final blow.",
				"armflash": "Blitz is a light, fast moving tank with close combat rapid fire weapon. It is slightly more powerful and faster than Peewee and A.K. on flat terrain. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco. In late T1 warfare Blitz can be used in large numbers for ambushing Commanders and speedy skirmishing. Light armor and short range makes it susceptible to defensive towers and riot tanks.",
				"armflea": "Fleas are supercheap and fast to build Bots used for scouting and damaging the early eco structures of enemies. It is faster than all Bots and most vehicles but any close confrontation will be lethal to it. Evade laser towers and destroy metal extractors to slow down your foe's expansion! In T2 warfare fleas come as an effective counter to slow shooting units, like snipers, penetrators and artillery. When produced constantly and sent to the front they can pull the heavy fire on themselves while your T2 units deal damage to artillery.",
				"armham": "The Hammer is a plasma Bot that can deal a sizeable damage with relatively low cost of building. It has a shorter range than rocket Bots, but if you manage to reach them, it can easily eliminate them. It has slightly higher HP than rocket Bots, hence it can be used in big numbers to destroy T1 defensive structures. Combine with resurrection Bots (Rectors), for healing and resurrecting fallen units, to quickly push the frontline. Effective for defending mountain tops, as their range is longer when shooting downhill. Watch out for Heavy Laser Turrets",
				"armjanus": "The Janus is a heavy dual rocket tank. Its slow moving speed and fire rate makes it susceptible to groups of fast moving units like PeeWees, but once it shoots it deals massive AoE damage, which can eliminate virtually all Bots (except Warriors) in a single blow. Combine with Samsons (rocket trucks) and repairing units to achieve devastating effect on enemy defenses. It is also a perfect unit for destroying Commanders, as only 5 shots is enough to deal lethal damage. It requires some good micro, so focus!",
				"armjeth": "Jethro is a cheap mobile anti air (AA) Bot, that can easily take down light aircrafts, like scouts, or transporters. Always send a few with your army to protect it from EMP drones/gunships or commander drop tactics. Remember that it has no land-to-land weapons, so it is not able to defend itself. In bigger numbers it can even prevent bombing runs. It is able to walk underwater - combine it with amphibious units!",
				"armkam": "The Banshee is a light gunship that can deal damage to land based units. It has very weak armor, that can be shattered by T1 anti air with ease, so always send them in packs and scout before striking. It is a weapon of surprise, try to keep it away from your foe's radars before attacking. If you succeed to put your gunships into an unguarded base, or over hostile Commander it will have no chance to survive. An effective attacking order is: nano towers -> AA towers,units -> eco and labs.",
				"armmlv": "The Podger is a stealthy minelayer/minesweeper unit, that can make your base feel really safe. It produces light and heavy mines which are designed to eliminate different levels of threat. Light mines can stop Pewees, A.K., Blitzes etc. and heavy can even stop most T2 units. IT's a cheap way to secure places where you don't have time to set up proper defenses, like your flanks. Always lay mines away from your opponent's line of sight and avoid having your own units on the minefield. To create effective minefields use Shift and drag with LMB while ordering a queue. REMEMBER that mines use energy to remain cloaked! Podgers can also detonate enemy's mines using the attack command.",
				"armpeep": "The Peeper is a cheap and fast moving air scout, that is not armed with any weapons, but a huge line of sight. It is used to gain intelligence on what your enemy is planning, and where he keeps his most important units. Information is the most valuable asset on the battlefield, knowing your opponent's plans you can prepare your counter strikes early, making his moves inefficient. In lategame a constant stream of scouts helps your artillery units, improving their aim.",
				"armpincer": "A pincer is a light amphibious tank which can travel on land and underwater equally well. It is weaker than most land based tanks, so to use it effectively avoid direct fire exchange and try to surprise your opponent by destroying undefended targets near the shoreline. Don't forget to send one or two amphibious constructors with your assault to reclaim left wrecks and claim metal spots on the way.",
				"armpw": "Peewee is a basic infantry Bot. Being very cheap to build and having high top speeds can be useful for scouting and taking down unguarded metal extractors and eco.

				"armrectr": "Rector is a resurrection Bot which can turn wrecks into brand new army members or reclaim them to get back your metal! It is fast and cheap to build, therefore it can serve as and ideal solution for reclaiming trees, rocks and other structures scattered across the map. It is essential to combine resurrection Bots with any attacking units so they can repair and resurrect/reclaim wrecks in real-time constantly reinforcing your army. It can be used to obtain constructors of the other fraction by resurrecting enemies wrecks.",

				"armrock": "Rocko is a light rocket Bot used mainly to push the frontline towards opponent's base. It can outrange light laser turrets so if your enemy expands solely with a Commander, Rockos can force him to retreat. In bigger numbers and with repairing support of resurrection Bots they are able to take down more advanced defensive structures. Very ineffective against fast mobile units, watch out for A.K./Peewees! To protect them use your Commander/Constructors to build progressing defense. In comparison to their CORTEX counterpart (Storms) they are a bit faster, but weaker at the same time",
				"armsam": "Samsons are long range light missile trucks. They can outrange most T1 defensive units and deal constant damage to it. They can also serve as basic anti-air defense. Very ineffective in close combat, so always try to keep them at full distance by using FIGHT command. In larger packs Samsons can even take down Heavy Laser Turrets. Combine with janus/stumpies and repairing units for a devastating frontline push! Move them in line, because they can't shoot over each other.",
				"armstump": "A Stout is a medium assault tank. It has a relatively high hp so it should always be kept in the first line to sink in all damage. Useful for taking down light defenses with its sheer force. If not microed well, Stumpies can be easily DGunned, so try to keep enemy Commanders at a distance. Combine with Samsons or artillery for a great frontline push or use large pasks for raiding enemy bases. Don't forget to bring some constructors with your assault for repairing and reclaiming wrecks.",
				"armthund": "The Thunder is a bomber, designed for destroying buildings. A little bit weaker than its CORTEX counterpart - Shadow. It drops bombs over the target and makes a flyby to reload its ammunition. It can strike every 9 seconds. Always scout first and combine with fighters to eliminate enemy's airwall before  bombing. Click A for attack and drag your RMB to execute a carpet bombing, or use area attack command to strike targets within a circle.",
				"armthundt4": "The Specialized Thunder T4 is a huge bomber with both matching strength and firepower.",
				"armwar": "Warrior is a durable Bot armed with a rapid firing double laser. It has a relatively high HP for T1 and can easily take down multiple light assault units, like A.K.'s, Peewees etc. Often referred to as 'mobile LLT'. Their range is enough to overshoot Commanders, so with a little micro it may be used to force them to retreat. Always combine with resurrection Bots for healing and resurrecting fallen units.",
				"corak": "A.K. is a light infantry Bot which is cheap and quick to build. Proves useful for scouting and taking down unguarded structures like metal extractors and early eco. It is armed with light, but precise laser with a little longer range than PeeWee, so with  little microing skills you can outrange them eaisily. In late T1 warfare A.K.'s can be used for ambushing Commanders and speedy skirmishing. However, light armor and relatively short range makes them very vulnerable to defensive towers and riot tanks.",
				"corbw": "Bladewings are little drones armed with EMP lasers. They can paralyze opponents units, but they can't deal any damage. They serve as a great support for your attacks and can turn the tide of war easily. However, they have very little armor and quickly vanish if faced with even basic anti-air. Always try to hide them from enemy's radars - surprise is their strength. Useful as a defense of last resort too.",
				"corca": "A Construction Aircraft is able to build basic T1 structures like the ones made by the Commander. Moreover it can build some more advanced land and air defense towers, advanced solar generators and most importantly the T2 Aircraft Plant. Due to their speed, the highest amongst constructors, it may be used for quick expansions and reclaiming in areas far from your base. It can also access the whole map, as it doesn't care about any natural obstacles. It has a very low HP, so keep away from enemy's anti air units. Due to little build power you may want to use multiple air cons at once. Each Construction Aircraft increases the player's energy and metal storage capacity by 25.",
